# Pokemon Pokedex

In this project, I built a Pokedex from Pokemon.

An API is consumed that gives the information of the Pokémon as name and type (fire, water, grass, etc.) and sends it to HTML.

* Only the 1° and 2° pokemons generation (Kanto & Johto) 

## Technologies
In this project I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
